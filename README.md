# NIASSA NUT CO WEBSITE

This is my first capstone project using the skills I have acquired thus far in my coding journey. I have made use of HTML, CSS, 
Bootstrap, Jquery, JSON and Javascript in order to create this website. I have created a simple ecommerce website with a
functioning cart using JS.
